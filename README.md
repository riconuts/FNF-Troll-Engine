# Friday Night Funkin': Troll Engine

Troll Engine is the fork of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) that's used on the [Tails Gets Trolled mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/320596).


## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/).

You'll also need to install a couple things that involve Gits. To do this, you need to do a few things first.
1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.

You'll also need to install each one of these Haxe libraries.

```
haxelib install flixel 5.2.2
haxelib install flixel-addons
haxelib install flixel-ui

haxelib install hscript
haxelib install hxCodec
haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc
haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit
```

(You can just paste them onto Command Prompt/PowerShell to install them)
